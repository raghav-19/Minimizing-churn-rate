# Minimizing Churn Rate through analysis of financial habits

## Introduction to Challenge

Subscription Products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries. These products can come in the form of a 'one size fits all overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level memberships. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, or what industry they are in, companies almost always try to minimize customer churn (a.k.a. subscription cancellations). 

To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify behavioral patterns that act as catalyst in disengagement with the product.

* Market: The target audience is the entirety of a company's subscription base. They are the ones companies want to keep.

* Product: The subscription products that customers are already enrolled in can provide value that users may not have imagined, or that they may have forgotten.

* Goal: The objective of this model is to predict which users are likely to churn, so that the company can focus on re-engaging these users with the product. These efforts can be email reminders about the benefits of the product, especially focusing on features that are new or that the user has shown to value.

## Business Challenge
We are in charge of identifying users who are likely to cancel their subscription so that we can start building new features that they may be interested in. These features can increase the engagement and interest of our users towards the product.

## Dataset
By subscribing to the membership, our customers have provided us with data on their finances, as well as how they handle those finances through the product. We also have some demographic information we acquired from them during the sign-up process.
